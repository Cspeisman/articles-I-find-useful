[The 4 layers of SPA](https://hackernoon.com/architecting-single-page-applications-b842ea633c2e) - This article provides a great template for architecting Single Page Applications while remaining view layer (framework: react, angular, vue) agnostic.


[devhints.io](https://devhints.io/) - Not a blog post or article but it is a cheatsheet for literally anything I'd ever need

[GIST Framework](https://itamargilad.com/gist-framework/) I've never tried this but I'd love to give it a shot. I strongly believe in quick feedback loops and validating assumptions early. I've had most success with lean product development but have found it to be really challenging to get teams to adopt it who have never done it before because it requires so much discipline and is fairly counter intuitive to how we view innovation and product development

[Tao of Node](https://alexkondov.com/tao-of-node/) - Offers great patterns and disciplines to follow in a world of freedom within Node/JS architecture.
